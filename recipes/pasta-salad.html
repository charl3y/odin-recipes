<h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pasta salad is a versatile and refreshing dish that's perfect for picnics, potlucks, or a light summer meal. 
        To create this delightful recipe, start by boiling your choice of pasta until it's cooked al dente. Popular options include rotini, 
        fusilli, or bowtie pasta, as they hold the dressing and ingredients well. Once cooked, rinse the pasta under cold water to stop the 
        cooking process and cool it down quickly.</p>
    
    <p>Next, it's time to assemble a colorful medley of fresh vegetables, such as cherry tomatoes, cucumber, bell peppers, and red onion, 
        all chopped into bite-sized pieces. You can also add some briny olives and tangy feta cheese for an extra burst of flavor. Toss the 
        cooled pasta and veggies together in a large bowl. For the dressing, whisk together olive oil, balsamic vinegar, minced garlic, 
        Dijon mustard, and a sprinkle of Italian herbs for a zesty, herbaceous flavor profile. Drizzle this delicious dressing over the 
        pasta and veggies, then gently mix everything together to ensure every bite is coated in the savory dressing. Finish with a sprinkle 
        of fresh basil or parsley for a burst of freshness. This pasta salad is a delightful combination of textures and flavors, making it 
        a crowd-pleasing favorite for any occasion. It's the perfect side dish to complement grilled meats, or you can even enjoy it as a 
        light, satisfying meal on its own. Its vibrant colors and mouthwatering taste make it an irresistible addition to your culinary 
        repertoire.</p>
